# A template for AngularJS 1.7.x apps

This is a fork of the [Seed App project template](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed), with the following differences:

1. uses the version 1.7.x of AngularJS;
2. uses `yarn` instead of `bower`.

*Warning*: this is still a work in progress, it is not ready for being used.
